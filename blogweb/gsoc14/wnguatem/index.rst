:project: A Bayesian Approach for fitting Geometric Models in 3D Point Clouds
:mentor: Zoltan-Csaba Marton

About me
--------
I am a graduate student at the Bundeswehr University Munich.

Introduction
-------------
PCL provides a greate frame work based on the ransac family of algorithms for fitting basic geometric primitives e.g Planes, Cylinders, e.t.c.
In this work however, we aim at solving the model fitting tasks using a Bayesian approach. Amongst others, this approach has the advantage of being very flexible and
generic i.e. both parametric and non-parametric (e.g. curves, surfaces using splines) models can be fitted.
