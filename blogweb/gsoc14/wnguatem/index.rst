:project: A Bayesian Approach for fitting Geometric Models in 3D Point Clouds

About the project
-----------------
PCL provides a greate frame work based on the ransac family of algorithms for fitting basic geometric primitives (Planes, Cylinders, ...).
In this work, we aim at takling the task of model fitting using a Bayesian approach. This approach has the advantage of being very flexible, thus,
and generic i.e. both parametric and non-parametric (e.g. curves, surfaces using splines) models can be fitted.
