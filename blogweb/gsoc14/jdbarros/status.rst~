  :title: Reduction of computational redundancy in cost aggregation in stereo matching.
  :author: jilliam
  :date: 21-06-2014

  **INTRODUCTION**
  A stereo image pair can be used to estimate the depth of a scene. To do so, it is necessary to perform pixel matching and find the correspondences in both images. Different methods for stereo correspondence have been proposed and they are classified in two classes:
  - Correlation-based algorithms: Produce a dense set of correspondences.
  - Feature-based algorithms: Produce a sparse set of correspondences.
  
  Additionally, correlation-based algorithms are usually classified in two main groups, local (window-based) or global algorithms. However, some methods do not fit into any group, and are more in between them.

  The current work is based on correlation-based algorithms, more espefically local and window based-methods, intended for applications where a dense and fast output is required.

  The input of the algorithm are two calibrated images, i.e. the camera geometry is known. The images are also rectified in order to limit the correspondence to a 1D search.
