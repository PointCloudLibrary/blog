  :title: Object discovery in KINFU DATA (First post)
  :author: Manuel_Gesto
  :date: 30-07-2014

        * **Introduction**
              
              The principal goal of this project will be implement the algorithm and app developed in:
              
              -Fei-Fei, L., Karpathy, A., Miller, S."Object discovery Via Shape Analysis".
               
               
               This automatic object discovery will be useful for robotics or autonomous vehicles and 
               it will be able to find different class of objects. This new approach compares different 
               parameters of an object to classify it into a class. We can explain the function of this 
               approach by giving a simple example: if we want to find a glass into an unknown room, we cannot 
               have a model of all the glasses in the world. But, we can have a number of parameters about the 
               shape that define the common parts of the glasses.
               
               The parameters that defined a object is based on the: "Objectness measures" part in the paper. This
               is the core of the app and the most important part. And probably a good part to begin to code because is
               quite easy to code.

  :title: First implementation of Code  "Objectness measures" (Second post)
  :author: Manuel_Gesto
  :date: 30-07-2014
  
         * **Introduction**
              
              I begin with main part of the code, and probably the most easy to implement. In this part I write the code
              to make this measures for each Point Cloud. The input in the code is a point cloud (or set of pointclouds) and the output a vector 
              with the values of the resultant measure. To simplify the code part and the use of this for other aplications, 
              this part is separated from the segmentation, also if anyone want to use other segmentation that the proposed in 
              the paper is usefull.
              
              
         * **"Objectnes measures"**
              We have 5 different measures:
              
              - Compactness: This measure looks into how compact is a object. Search the minimum bounding sphere
                that contains all the surface of the mesh of the pointcloud.
                
              - Symmetry: This measure analyze the reflective symmetry along the three principal axes, based on the
                eigenvalues of the scatter matrix.
                
              - Smoothness: This measure evaluate the quality of the points of the segments, if the segments have points
                uniform spread around it, this will score high, if have spread points this will be have a low score.
                
              - Local Convexity: This measure determine the convexity of each polygon edge in the mesh of the point cloud,
                and score each segment by the percentage of its edges which are convex.
                
              - Global Convexity: This measure is generated by a convex hull, and after that a mean distance
                between the points and the convex hull is recorded to create this measure.
                

         * **"Future Work"**          
            
              In the future work, I need to implement the segmentation to give data to measure the objects and test this code.
              
              Also, there is one measure missing, one that use all the segments in diferent scenes to make a better clasification.
              This is the "recurence", but this depends on the on the number of scenes and segments, this need the segmentation before
              and analyze the number of similar segments in the objects in all scenes. Objects with similar segments should be in the 
              same category.

  :title: Second implementation of Code  "Segmentation and creation of object candidates" (Third post)
  :author: Manuel_Gesto
  :date: 30-07-2014
  
         * **Introduction**
              
              I am working on it, This is based on the Segmentation proposed by y Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher.
