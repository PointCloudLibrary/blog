:project: Automated benchmark generation for object-part segmentation 
:mentor: Jeremie Papon

About me
--------
I am a PhD student at the University of Goettingen - Germany. My research interests include computer vision (most specifically object / part recognition) as well as machine learning. I have been heavily working with PCL and OpenCV in my research.

Project Description
-------------------
This project consists of two parts: First, implementation of the paper [Stein et al. accepted for CVPR 2014]. The focus of this segmentation is getting nameable parts of objects for e.g. robot applications (for instance the handle of a hammer to pick it up or the head, hands, ... of a human). Second, automated generation of artificial scenes to create a unit-test/benchmarking functionality for 3D segmentation. I will implement a shape generator to dynamically assemble these scenes.
