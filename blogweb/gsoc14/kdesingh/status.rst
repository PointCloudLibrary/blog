  :title: Richtsfeld's code and results (First post)
  :author: kdesingh
  :date: 16-06-2014

        * **Introduction**

                Goal of this project is to integrate cluttered scene segmentation methods into pcl::segmentation. 
                This sprint involves implementation of modules from two publications below. 
        

                - Z.-C. Marton, F. Balint-Benczedi, O. M. Mozos, N. Blodow, A. Kanezaki, L. C. Goron, D. Pangercic, and M. Beetz: Part-based geometric categorization and object reconstruction in cluttered table-top scenes; Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems, January 2014

                - A.-Richtsfeld, T. MÃ¶rwald, J. Prankl, M. Zillich and M. Vincze: Learning of Perceptual Grouping for Object Segmentation on RGB-D Data; Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation (JVCI), Special Issue on Visual Understanding and Applications with RGB-D Cameras, July 2013
        
                These papers have made their code available and has pcl implementation to some extent already. But we will aim to make the modules interoperable in our implementation.

        * **Richtsfeld's code and results**
         
                As a first step, Richtsfeld's code was analyzed. Below is the highlevel picture of the structure of his code base along with comments on their functionality.
        
                .. image:: images/v4r.png

                        :height: 1100px
                        :align: center

                His code was tested on some scenes that were grabbed by me using Kinect. Below are the snapshots of the same.
        
                .. image:: images/scene_01.png
                        :width: 650px
                        :height: 250px
                        :align: center

                .. image:: images/scene_02.png
                        :width: 650px
                        :height: 250px
                        :align: center

                .. image:: images/scene_03.png
                        :width: 650px
                        :height: 250px
                        :align: center

                His code works on organized pointcloud of type PointXYZRGB.

                Code is yet to be tested for quantitative results with our annotated dataset. 

        * **Brainstorming**
                
                These are some of the discussions I had with my mentor Zoltan and the summary is listed below.
                        
				- Zoltan's work classifies the relations based on features computed on group of segments as 1-8 elements in a group.
				- Richtsfeld's work classifies the relations based on segment pairs.
				- Richtsfeld's work is limited to organized pointcloud and cannot handle a cloud that is fused out of many pointclouds of a scene say through registration.
				- Richtsfeld's work computes features which are inspired from Gestalt's principles. There are someother features that are worth testing. These are the features used for structure discovery in a pointcloud data. Features are as below and more details on them are available in the publication - Collet, Alvaro, Siddhartha S. Srinivasa, and Martial Hebert. "Structure discovery in multi-modal data: a region-based approach." Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2011 IEEE International Conference on. IEEE, 2011.
				- Additional features to test are:

						- Shape Model
						- Self Continuity
						- Contour compactness
						- Pair continuity
						- Verticality
						- Concavity
						- Projection
						- Alignment
						- Surface compatibility

  :title: RSD Feature computation and analysis
  :author: kdesingh
  :date: 26-06-2014

  RSD Feature is a local feature histogram that describes the surface local to a query point. There is pcl implementation for this that is available in the features folder. 
  With the help of my mentor I understood the algorithm by which this feature is obtained. To very if this is working perfectly we took a real object whose radius is known and 
  generated the RSD computation on the entire point cloud of the object. This gives RSD Feature Histogram for all the points in the pointcloud. We can also get the min and max 
  radius of the local surface patch around each point in the pointcloud. 
  I generated various combination of parameters to know how the radius computed varies. Below is the object used which has a radius of 3.5cm which is 0.035m
  
                  .. image:: images/coffee_mug.png
                        :width: 333px
                        :height: 400px
                        :align: center

  Below are some of the params chosen and their corrresponding effect on the min and max radius in the local surface patch of each point.
  For Normal Radius search = 0.03
  Max_radius = 0.7 (maximum radius after which everything is plane)
  RSD_radius search = 0.03

                        :align: center
                        
  For Normal Radius search = 0.03
  
  Max_radius = 0.1 (maximum radius after which everything is plane)
  
  RSD_radius search = 0.03
  
                  .. image:: images/s2.png

                        :align: center
                        

  For Normal Radius search = 0.02
  
  Max_radius = 0.1 (maximum radius after which everything is plane)
  
  RSD_radius search = 0.03 - This is found to be good way for generating histograms
  
  
                  .. image:: images/s3.png
                        :width: 1080px
                        :height: 400px
                        :align: center
                        
  I tried to do MLS smoothing on the point cloud data and then compute the RSD feature which makes the normal computation better and resulting in
  consistency over all the points on the object surface.
  
  For Normal Radius search = 0.03
  
  Max_radius = 0.7 (maximum radius after which everything is plane)
  
  RSD_radius search = 0.03

                        :align: center

                        :align: center
                        

  For Normal Radius search = 0.02

                        :align: center
                        
                                                
  Now I tested out how the actual feature looks like at a point on the sphere to check if it matches with the histogram in the paper.
  The same is compared between raw point cloud from the kinect and MLS smoothened point cloud. Below is the result of the same.

                        :align: center
                        
  It was really hard to fix the previous image that it can show the histograms with values and good resolution. So below is the snapshot of the spherical and cylinderical surfaces.

                        :align: center
                        
  Spherical Surface:

  Next post will have the details of how GRSD results are and how they differentiate the characteristics of two surfaces. GRSD code from the author will be integrated into the PCL code base. We also plan to categorize the pipeline into modules that fit into the PCL code base as features, surface and segmentation sections. These information will be posted in the next post.

  :title: GRSD Descriptor computation and analysis
  :author: kdesingh
  :date: 28-07-2014

  Global Radius-based surface descriptor concatenates the RSD descriptor as discussed in the previous post to represent the complete object.
  GRSD gives a good description of the 3D shape of the object. Below are the set of objects and its GRSD descriptors i.e. histograms. I have
  used University of Washington's "Large scale RGBD dataset" for the experiments.
                      
  For an object whose surface is planar but has 2 different planes in the view
                      .. image:: images/box_image.png
                        :height: 240px
                      .. image:: images/box.png
                        :height: 200px


  For an object whose surface is planar but has 1 planes in the view
                      .. image:: images/plane_image.png
                        :height: 240px
                      .. image:: images/plane.png
                        :height: 200px

  For an object whose surface is spherical
                      .. image:: images/sphere_image.png
                        :height: 240px
                      .. image:: images/sphere.png
                        :height: 200px

  For an object whose surface is cylinderical but doesn't have any planar surface in view
                      .. image:: images/cylinder_image.png
                        :height: 240px
                      .. image:: images/cylinder.png
                        :height: 200px

  It can be seen that all the descriptors are different from eachother. Planes and box surfaces are similar as the surface characteristics
  are similar in this case.                         
  Both GRSD and RSD are pushed into the pcl-trunk for people to use. The test files for these two features are also included in the trunk
  for the basic usage of the same.

  Currently working on the NURBS for small surface patches. Since NURBS are already available in PCL we will be looking at how to tailor the
  same for our needs. After this we plan to work on the features that compute the relationship between the surface patches.
